# 3200_importing_views_without__blueprints_examples

The two directories contain small examples of how to import views into flask.

For larger applications use blueprints
(see my repo: https://github.com/lfernandez55/3200_flask_full_directory_tutorial)

To run the one titled "Importing views:"

pip install flask
set flask_app=flaskr.py
flask run

To run the one titled "Importing views with package:"

pip install flask
python main.py
